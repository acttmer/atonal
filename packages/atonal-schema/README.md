Build stateless HTTP JSON API endpoints with router and validation

## When to use

To improve speed and convenience, `application/json` is the only supported content type.

If you are building stateless JSON APIs, it's a great framework for you.

Besides, stateful features like cookie will also not be supported.

It's better to use this framework with platforms like Cloudflare that supports reverse proxy.

## Features

- Fully type safe
- Super fast
- Super easy to use
- Only support HTTP (no HTTPs or HTTP/2)
- Only support JSON content type (application/json)
